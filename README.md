# Unity Game 2 - Respect Popular Gods
This game is the second one that I made for a subject in Computer Engine Degree. It aims to be a prototype of a 3D role-playing game. The game was made with the help of a partner (the name is Gonzalo Mu√±oz Quintero and he was in charge of the UI, music and effects).

For this game, we followed some parts of this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4KLGCCAciWQ5qHudKtYeP7

In the game, the player will take a sword and a shield, will take them from the inventory and will use them to fight an enemy. He can too choose between walk, run a little or run faster. He can't attack while running and can't start walking until he stops the attack. 

The enemy will use fuzzy logic to decide the best action in combat. Once the enemy dies, you win the game.

## **Things to improve in the future**
- Enemy AI: It should be modified to not decide again until the former action has been completed
- Gameplay and UI: UI should be modified to tell the player the next goal, not allow the enemy spawn until the player has taken the Sword and Shield.
